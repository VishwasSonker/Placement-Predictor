### My first ever ML model

A simple Machine Learning web app built with **Logistic Regression** and **Streamlit** that predicts whether a student is likely to get placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ score**.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts placement chances using **Logistic Regression**
- User-friendly **Streamlit** web interface
- Instant predictions without retraining the model
- Easy to deploy and share

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn – for training Logistic Regression
- Streamlit – for creating the web interface
- Pickle – for saving/loading the trained model

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters **CGPA** and **IQ** into the web app.
2. Model (`model.pkl`) predicts:
   - **1** → Likely to get placed ✅
   - **0** → Not likely to get placed ❌
3. Result is displayed instantly in the web app.
